## 📖 What is hypnoR?

hypnoR is the hypnogram layer of the Circadia Lab R ecosystem. It sits
between raw signal sources and the integrated participant database,
providing a common interface for sleep staging regardless of where the
staging came from.

It accepts two staging resolutions:

- **Full AASM** (5-state: `W` / `N1` / `N2` / `N3` / `REM`) — supplied
  by **mrpheus**
- **Coarse** (3-state: `W` / `Sleep` / `Quiet sleep`) — supplied by
  **zeitR**

All metric functions are resolution-agnostic: they compute every metric
that is possible given the available stages and return `NA` with an
informative message for metrics that require full AASM staging.

Downstream, hypnoR feeds into `syncR::sync()` as part of the unified
participant-indexed database.

## ✨ Features

- **Flexible ingestion** —
  [`read_hypnogram()`](https://hypnor.circadia-lab.uk/reference/read_hypnogram.md)
  reads EDF annotations, CSV, YASA output, Compumedics Profusion, and
  Nox Medical formats.

- **Architecture metrics** —
  [`compute_sleep_architecture()`](https://hypnor.circadia-lab.uk/reference/compute_sleep_architecture.md)
  returns TST, SE, SOL, WASO, REM latency, SWS latency, and stage
  percentages; all metrics degrade gracefully for coarse hypnograms.

- **Cycle segmentation** —
  [`compute_cycles()`](https://hypnor.circadia-lab.uk/reference/compute_cycles.md)
  detects NREM/REM cycles via Feinberg & Floyd (1979) or AASM rules.

- **Transition analysis** —
  [`compute_transitions()`](https://hypnor.circadia-lab.uk/reference/compute_transitions.md)
  builds a stage-to-stage transition probability matrix and computes a
  fragmentation index.

- **Publication-ready plots** —
  [`plot_hypnogram()`](https://hypnor.circadia-lab.uk/reference/plot_hypnogram.md),
  [`plot_architecture()`](https://hypnor.circadia-lab.uk/reference/plot_architecture.md),
  and
  [`plot_transition_matrix()`](https://hypnor.circadia-lab.uk/reference/plot_transition_matrix.md)
  all use `theme_circadia()` from the **circadia** shared visual
  identity package.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** R ≥ 4.1, `remotes`.

``` r

remotes::install_github("circadia-bio/hypnoR")
```

To reproduce the vignettes with real evaluated output (rather than just
the code), also install **mrpheus** from its r-universe:

``` r

install.packages(
  "mrpheus",
  repos = c("https://circadia-bio.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

**Basic workflow:**

``` r

library(hypnoR)

hyp  <- read_hypnogram("night_001.csv")
arch <- compute_sleep_architecture(hyp)
cyc  <- compute_cycles(hyp)           # full AASM only
trans <- compute_transitions(hyp)

plot_hypnogram(hyp)
plot_architecture(arch)
plot_transition_matrix(trans$matrix)
```
